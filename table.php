<p> A little about me!</p>
<p>I am an aspiring Robotics Engineer and Cryptocurrency and Forex Trader. I am not a regular mom. I am a cool mom! My daughter, Jewel, is an amazing and always joyful light who gives my life balance. I enjoy teaching her new skills and listening to her vivid perception on various topics and her witty humor. Aside from my parental responsibilities, I enjoy listening to all types of music with the eception of heavy metal. Not that I hate heavy metal music, I just think it's more of an acquired taste. Honestly, I am huge fan of all of the arts. When I'm not in college, I am an avid literary connoiseur. I enjoy live theatre, visiting museums and discussing art history. As a budding programmer, I am also engaging in programming arts. Like most other people from the Pacific Northwest, I love being out in nature specifically, hiking and stand up paddle boarding. Cooking, gaming and bingeing on streaming services are also very enjoyable pasttimes for me. As a charismatic summer child, I love meeting new like-minded people and physical, live social networking engagements.</p>
