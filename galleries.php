<p>Galleries are almost like the life force of most major websites especially for e-commerce sites. Without galleries, galleries can feel void and “naked” though it could be full of textual content. In a vividly visual physical world, we as humans expect our digital world to be just as, if not more than, vivid and physically appealing. In fact, CSS Script states on their website, “A gallery lets you showcase your images, products, and any other web contents in an elegant way.” (CSS Script, 2017).A recently published article from their site reviews and evaluates 10 galleries that can be implemented via HTML, CSS, CSS3 and/ or Javascript. One gallery that was evaluated is the CSS Box. According to the review, CSS Box, “[Is] [a] minimal, responsive image gallery lightbox where the user is able to navigate between full sized images in a fullscreen lightbox popup. Built using CSS / CSS3 and plain html markup.flexbin.css is a lightweight, flexible CSS library which lets you create responsive, neat, justified grid layout for showcasing your photos as you seen on Google Image Search and Flickr. Heavily based on CSS3 flexbox and fully customizable via SCSS.”(CSS Script, 2017). Envatouts+ is another reputable web development website that evaluates and reviews options for web designers. Envatouts shared on their website that their perspective concerning galleries as such, “A lot of websites which sell some kind of product or services will have images or videos to showcase how good they are at their job. How you present your awesome work to prospective clients plays an important role in determining how your revenue grows over the years.”(Shooken, 2019). No matter what type of site you develop it best to always include nice images for the user to view, especially if you are hoping to sell a product to them.
