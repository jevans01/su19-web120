<p>On average any modern day smartphone user has access to download any number of mobile and desktop applications that are widely available on the Internet. Web browsers today support responsive websites and mobile apps in order to offer a variety of ways to access information. According to SmashStack, “Responsive mobile design generally means that your site is designed specifically for mobile use. It will often be housed under a different URL (usually something like m.yoursite.com) and will feature subsets of your desktop content that are appropriate for mobile viewing.” (SmashStack, 2017).Responsive design web pages are encoded to be adaptable to the user’s device screen size. Conversely, the wildly popular mobile app option is described by SmashStack as, “ specific applications customized to each Operating System (OS) that feature unique designs and codebases.” (SmashStack, 2017). Mobile apps are more costly and take more time to develop however, they “offer users a top-shelf experience.”(SmashStack, 2017). A few things to consider when deciding between native mobile apps and responsive web design include: timewise, “Launching a mobile site is a faster process than designing an application. Nearly all businesses these days need mobile sites to stay competitive anyway, so creating a responsive mobile experience is the least that developers can do.” (SmashStack, 2017).. Essentially, it is not a choice between which option should your business have but rather a question of how much resources should be allocated to each option. To further clarify the importance of investing in a top-tier native mobile app, The Interactive Design Foundation states, “The biggest advantages to native apps are that they can normally access all the functionality of the chosen device easily and that they are more likely, if developed properly, to run without error on the device. this comes with a trade-off. A native app cannot be run on a device which doesn’t utilize the same operating system.” (Zollman, 2019).
