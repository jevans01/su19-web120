<p>Flexbox is a newer and very popular web design strategy. According to the W3 Shools, “Flexbox is a very useful and easy to use flexible, responsive layout structure without using float or positioning.”(w3Schools, n.d). This gives designers unparalleled control of site design and layout. This is the reason why we have more innovative and interesting sites to this day. The support and compatibility of flexbox is just as popular with majority of browsers supporting flexbox even in their older outdated versions. To further explain, CSSMine, “Flexbox is just a new value of the display property, making it very useful if we want the former inline or inline-block elements to stack on top of each other. If a browser does not support flexbox, the elements will simply stack on top of each other the same way they do in mobile device browsers.” (Martin, 2017.). In the sources the Interneting is Hard, lists and goes step by step the benefits of using flexbox and how it is supported within the browser. </p>
